## Requirements

Python3

Pytorch


## Training

To train the models in the paper, run this command:

```train
python ccl_training.py
```

Set 'method' in the code either 'ccl' or 'cclalt'.

'ccl': Train by CCL

'cclalt': Train by CCLalt. Require 'pair' parameter

## Evaluation

To evaluate the trained model, run:

```eval
python ccl_evaluation.py
```
